### Template Sensors ###
template:

# Confirm that the template sensors are providing correct values before using this package, 
# or erroneous data will be populated in the Riemann Sum and Utility Meter sensors.

  - sensor:

    # Current Power Import from Grid / Export to Grid
    # The sensor name used here is for the GoodWe integration using an EH inverter
    # which provides values in watts. 

    # Instructions: 
    # Rewrite the state of these sensors to work with your inverter to return a
    # positive value in kW for power imported from the grid and exported to the grid.

    # correctionFactor is a multiplier to adjust your inverter's power values so
    # they are close to the power values provided by your smart meter to your
    # retailer. Start with a value of 1.00 and adjust it when you can compare it
    # with your retailer's usage data.
